    "### Lab rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  This lab is to be done *individually*. You may talk to your fellow classmates about general issues (*\"Remind me again: What's the difference between a parameter and an argument?\"*) but not about the specifics of how to do these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Along a similar vein, you can ask the TA for help, but ask questions about **concepts**.  (i.e. *\"I don’t understand how the else block works\"*, not \"*my program isn’t doing what I want\"*).  The TA is there to help, but not to do your work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  You are welcome to use the class resources and the Internet. But try to google for *concepts*, not your specific tasks.  The goal for you to begin to start thinking algorithmically, and hopefully memorize a little syntax by osmosis. If you just blindly do the exercises, without actually *thinking* about them, the next time you see something related but slightly altered — like, say, on an exam — you won’t be able to solve the problem. So avoid brainlessly cutting and pasting code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Play with variations. Solve one of the problems, and then copy the code to a new cell and play around with it. Experiment! Break stuff! Doing this is **the single most important thing** when learning a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  When you have finished all the exercises, let the TA know, and he will check your work.  Presuming you’ve done things correctly, you’re free to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Have fun!\n",
