1. 
I use Pandas dataframe to store the data, so it is quite easy to manipulate the data, visualize the data and do exploratory data analysis.

2.

3.
The data is stored locally on a csv file, called 'Ice and Fire.csv'

4.
I would add a new coding block begining with 'if sys.argv[1] == 'new_source':
so that there would be a new option when enting the command line and the new data source would be loaded in to the existing dataset.

5.
I would add a new column in the dataframe, so that the dataframe can store this new information.
