1. 
I use Pandas dataframe to store the data, so it is quite easy to manipulate the data, visualize the data and do exploratory data analysis.

2.
Since all the data is stored in a csv file rather than a SQLite, when the dataset is getting really larger, it will takes more time to do some data operation.

3.
I store the dataset locally on a csv file, called 'Ice and Fire'

4.
I would add a new coding block beginning with 'if sys.argv[1] == 'new_source':'
So there would be a more option when entering the command window, which allows the new dataset going in.

5.
I would add a new column in the existing dataframe, so that the new information or attribute can merge into the original dataset.
